One of the most widely used technologies now-a-days in the field of information technology and its enabled services is cloud computing. With the help of online computing resources, cloud computing, an internet-based network technology, has contributed to the rapid advancement of communication technology by serving clients with a range of needs. Its resources include platforms for software creation, testing tools, and both hardware and software applications. Services are used to carry out this resource delivery. Due to its remarkable qualities and advantages, including great flexibility, scalability, and dependability, a number of researchers and service providers are moving towards it. Lowcost virtual organizations and resources are provided through the cloud. The main reason why cloud computing is so popular is because it provides virtualization. Customers can access resources using cloud computing based on their needs.
Although there are numerous advantages to cloud computing, there are also significant challenges, including those related to load balancing, work scheduling, VM migration, security, and many more. 3 When resources are used as effectively as feasible, a cloud computing model is effective, and this effective use can be done by implementing and maintaining adequate management of cloud resources.
By using effective resource scheduling, allocation, and scalability approaches, resource management can be accomplished. Customers receive these resources in the form of Virtual Machines (VM) thanks to the virtualization process, which makes use of the hypervisor, a component that can be either software or hardware or both. The biggest benefit of cloud computing is the conversion of a single user physical machine into a multiuser virtual machine. With the limited virtual resources that are now accessible, the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has a significant impact on how services are delivered to consumers.
